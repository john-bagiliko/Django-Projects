# Django-Projects
This django app allows all to add add a school, view a school, 
delete a school and  modify a school school. Anybody can 
make an api request and will have the ability to do anything with it.
There are no security securtiy measures in place for now.

This was done with django 2.0.
 I also created the a rest api for it using the django rest_framework.

To test this app, go to Django Rest framework site
http://www.django-rest-framework.org/
and follow the instructions.

Use 
$ pip install Django==2.0.5 

to have django installed

Clone the repository into your directory as:

$cd your_directory
$git clone https://github.com/john-bagiliko/Django-Projects.git

$cd Django-Projects/MySchool
$python manage.py runserver 5000

go to your browser and type 

 http://127.0.0.1:5000/school

Let me know if it worked for you.
